# Miscellaneous Jenkins Notes

- The [Jenkins 2.0 Virtual Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emV60CcDVV0) may be a good source of information.
- The loader plugin seems like it might be a good way to eliminate a ton of boilerplate code.

- The Docker pipeline plugin sounds really promising too. Having a DSL for launching Docker containers would be really
  convenient.
