- Ultimate metric is the number of future experiments that are made based on hypotheses gleaned from this data.


# Authentication

- How is someone from GeneLab going to get to CyVerse? How are we going to correlate GeneLab users to CyVerse users?
- Can they use CyVerse CAS?
- https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.3.x/protocol/WS-Federation-Protocol.
- Do users have to be authenticated to download data? I suspect that they don't, but I should confirm.


# Integration Ideas

- Dashboard with plugins or angular.

# Technical Questions

- How do we link to an analysis using a custom set of data sets if we're using quick launches?
    - One way would be to do this using the API, but we're not going to have that option initially.
    - Quick launches aren't available yet. If we're going to prototype this now, how are we going to do it?

# My own questions

- How did Nirav know to mention info type in relation to handling big data?

# Things to do

1. Send QuickLaunch documentation to the team.
2. Try to start working with user interfaces.
3. Design a way to add custom parameters to a quick launch URL. Watch out for query string length limits.
