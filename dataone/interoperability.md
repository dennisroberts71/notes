## Challenges

- Identifier and versining challenges.
  - Different types of identifiers used at different repositories.
  - DOIs are becomig more popular, which is good because of the associated resolution service.
- Data duplication.
- API compatibility.
- Socio-cultural challenges.

## Use Cases

- We have to work with other repositories because the NSF requires it.
- A researcher knows one data set submission format, but the data is a better fit for another repository.
- Windows into large sets of data from the perspectives of different types of users.
- Duplication might not be as much of a problem if duplicate data sets view the data from different perspectives.
  - I'm not convinced that this requires duplication.
  - I suppose it might require duplication in the case of a really large data set or a computationally intensive
    derivation process.
