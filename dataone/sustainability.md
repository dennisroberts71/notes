# DataONE Sustainability

- Sustainability through grants.
  - Harder to get grants for maintaining existing infrastructure.
  - Support of physical infrastructure is better accepted than support of data storage infrastructure.
  - Need to increase the visibility of the need for data storage infrastructure maintenance.
