# Updated Procedures for Deploying to QA Environments

- Possibly merge our Jenkins servers.
- How can we manage shared locks? Using a separate lock for each service came to mind, but I'd want to think about that
  for a while before proposing the idea.
- Document our current procedures so that we can identify where improvements are needed.
- Jenkins will automatically increment versions.
- If deployments are going to be automated then exactly how are we planning to document the versions? The ticket
  validation will be manual, so we can update the tickets at that time.
- Notification if something fails and rolls back.
- SMS messages from Jenkins?
- *Create a deployment tracking database to maintain records of deployment.*
- Next meeting on March 30.
